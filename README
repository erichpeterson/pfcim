COMPILING:
Although originally developed on Mac OS X 10.6, PFCIM should compile fine on any platform using 
an up-to-date C++ compiler. A simple Makefile is included in this package, and will hopefully 
compile the program for you if you are on a Linux/Unix machine, and you have Boost 1.44.0 or greater installed. You will need to change the CXX_CFLAGS variable in the file Makefile to the correct path of your boost installation. Then simply type the following in 
the same directory as the program files (and hit enter):

make

RUNNING:
On a Linux/Unix machine, the program can be run as follows:

./pfcim -input <input_filename> -tau <(0, 1]> [-options <option_input>]

Command Line Options:
	-eta Eta min support: [1-Size of DB] default: 1
	-tau Tau frequent probability threshold: (0-1] (Required)
	-input Input file name (Required)
	-output Output file name default: none
	-exec Execution stats file name default: none
	-print Print found clusters: {0 | 1} (0 = false, 1 = true) default 0
	
Example using all availible commandline options:

./pfcim -input inputfile.txt -tau 0.9 -eta 1000 -output outputfile.txt -exec execfile.txt -print 1 

DATABASE / INPUT FILE FORMAT:
The input file should have each object on a new line, and have each item seperated by a space, and HAVING A SPACE AFTER THE LAST ITEM OF EACH ROW. NO NEWLINE AFTER THE LAST ROW.
Each item should be of the form item:prob, where item is an integer identifying the item and prob being the probability of that item occurring between (0, 1].

Example Database:

1:0.8 2:0.5 3:0.24
2:0.4 5:0.99
1:0.13 3:0.6
